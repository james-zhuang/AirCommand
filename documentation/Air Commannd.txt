Game
	On start, the main menu pops up, giving you two options: 
		1) The Tutorial gives you an intuitive, basic introduction on how to play.
		2) The Multi-Player connects you to another computer, where both players are out on the screen. A 
		   small pane on the side shows a health bar and an overheating bar(Over heating causes the plane to stop firing)
		   When the enemy plane is shot down, a victory  screen appears and you disconnect. Otherwise, if you get shot down, 
		   a tutorial option will come up, and a defeat screen will appear.
